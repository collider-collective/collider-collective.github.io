    Construction and Destruction (2021)<br><br>
    Ten minutes and another truck crawls its way past, delivering supplies to the concrete manufacturer across the road. As the sun speeds towards the horizon, the procession of cars and utes laden with fishing equipment becomes more frequent - their journey ends at the end of the road by the river, which is now some 400m east of where it once lay, displaced, seemingly without a trace.<br>COLLIDER began to retrace the First Ecologies of the Maribyrnong and Birrarung river systems  in an effort to unlearn and question our settler/occupier histories. In doing so, we found enormous acts of violence committed against the First Ecologies of these systems hiding in plain sight; expertly forgotten. Like so many aspects of colonisation, the everlasting and irreversible effects on these systems are disturbingly quiet and largely unquestioned. In 1879, John Coode recommended a series of alterations to the Maribyrnong and Birrarung rivers. The Maribyrnong was deconstructed and re-routed to prevent the frequent and necessary flooding of the area. Once a vast wetland, the area is now host to concrete factories, oil storage facilities and a sugar processing port. The activity of industry silences the echoes of a once thriving natural ecosystem. A destructive event, on a scale so large it’s almost unimaginable in the minds of settlers/occupiers.  <br>In response to the discovery of this unseen marker of violence and colonisation, COLLIDER sought to return the water to its original place. The collective has produced a series of performative photographic works through returning water from the reconstructed bank of Maribyrnong to various First Sites of the river, that have since been destroyed. A small gesture we hope makes visible the extent of the far reaching damage caused by colonisation; past, present, and ongoing. <br>Created as a Submission for Co-Publishing Issue 02: Water.
