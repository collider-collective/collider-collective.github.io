    <p>COLLIDER operates on the unceded land of the Woi Wurrung and Boon Wurrung language groups of the Eastern Kulin Nations.<br><br>
    COLLIDER accepts the continued responsibility we, and other non-Indigenous people share in actively unlearning settler histories. We reject our ancestors’ assertion of ‘terra nullius’ and acknowledge that sovereignty has never been ceded, we pay our respects to Elders past, present.<br><br>
    COLLIDER also acknowledges First Nations People who were forcibly removed or otherwise displaced from their families and traditional lands, who now call the Kulin Nation’s home.<br><br>
    COLLIDER will actively involve collaboration and critique to problematise our work.<br><br>
    COLLIDER will make work that responds to the tensions and violences of the world we live in.<br><br>
    COLLIDER will make work exploring the intersections of contemporary culture.<br><br>
    We consider tactility and materiality as essential, and will prioritise sensory immersion over profits.<br><br>
    COLLIDER belives in equitable access to civic content</p><p>COLLIDER believes in the necessity of print.</p><br>
